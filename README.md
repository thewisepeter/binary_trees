0x1D. C - Binary trees

A binary tree is a fundamental data structure used in computer science and mathematics to organize and store data in a hierarchical manner. It consists of nodes connected by edges, where each node can have at most two child nodes referred to as the left child and the right child. The topmost node of the tree is called the root, and nodes without any children are known as leaf nodes.

Binary trees are powerful because they enable efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations with time complexities of O(log n) on average for balanced trees. They find wide applications in various fields, including database management systems, binary search algorithms, and data compression. The organization of nodes in a binary tree allows for orderly representation of data and efficient traversal methods to access all nodes systematically.
